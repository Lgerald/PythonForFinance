# PythonForFinance

This repo is the artifact of me working through selected chapters of Yves Hilpisch's book Python for Finance (2nd edition)
and addinging additional comments for myself.

My main goals from working through this book were to deepen my understanding of Monte Carlo simulations of stochastic
pricing models for security price evolution, trading strats, derivatives and derivative portfolios.
